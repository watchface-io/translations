Tactical watchfaces inspired by the Tactix7 watchface

⭐️ Free vs Pro ⭐️
This watchface is available at no cost with all basic functions. Premium features (marked with [*]) require a Pro Key to unlock. You can purchase a Pro Key here: https://ko-fi.com/s/d120236b33 Or purchase the PRO version here: https://apps.garmin.com/apps/04ddb981-131d-41ac-913a-c0d984009deb

⭐️ MIPS Devices (Fenix 7, Enduro, Forerunner 255, etc) ⭐️
This watchface is fully optimized for MIPS, but colors will look different as in most pictures, as these are taken on an Amoled device. This watchface has many themes optimized for MIPS and supports MIPS gradients. You can find all the built-in themes here: https://watchface.io/tactix7/themes#MIPS

⭐️ Datafields ⭐️
All datafields that Garmin currently supplies to third party developers are available, plus extras like Glucose Monitor (CGM) support, Open Weather Map (OWM) and support for other third party apps.
All available datafields are listed here: https://watchface.io/docs/datafields . Some datafields (like training readiness or HRV) are currently not available to third party developers, see here: https://watchface.io/faq/can-you-add-training-readiness
