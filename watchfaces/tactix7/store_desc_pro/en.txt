Tactical watchfaces inspired by the Tactix7 watchface

⭐️ Try before you buy! ⭐️
Before buying this watchface, check out the free version first to make sure it is what you want and that you like what it looks like on your watch: https://apps.garmin.com/apps/6067e1bd-69e3-4b57-b44a-d5dee550aee5

⭐️ MIPS Devices (Fenix 7, Enduro, Forerunner 255, etc) ⭐️
This watchface is fully optimized for MIPS, but colors will look different as in most pictures, as these are taken on an Amoled device. This watchface has many themes optimized for MIPS and supports MIPS gradients. You can find all the built-in themes here: https://watchface.io/tactix7/themes#MIPS
