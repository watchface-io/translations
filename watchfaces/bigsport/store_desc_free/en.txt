A highly readable sports watch face featuring extra-large, bold digits for instant time visibility.

⭐️ Free vs PRO ⭐️
This watchface is available at no cost with all basic functions. Premium features (marked with [*]) require a Pro Key to unlock. You can purchase a Pro Key here: https://ko-fi.com/s/5ed1d56531 or https://apps-developer.garmin.com/apps/912c8b54-5c9e-4c52-9070-b3d36a4764cb.

⭐️ MIPS Devices (Fenix 7, Enduro, Forerunner 255, etc) ⭐️
This watchface is fully optimized for MIPS, but colors can look different as in most pictures, as these are taken on an Amoled device. This watchface has many themes optimized for MIPS and supports MIPS gradients. You can find all the build in themes here: https://watchface.io/bigsport/themes#MIPS
